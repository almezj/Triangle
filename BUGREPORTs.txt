//LEAVE BUGS YOU FIND HERE IF THEY ARE FIXED PUT FIXED BY username

1. Pressing the back button from the exercise screen gets stuck on the transition screen rather than taking the user back to the activities pathway. (Loading screen)

2. Spamming the correct answer in an exercises completes all the exercises in the activities pathway

3. Tapping on an exercise on the activities pathway that hasn't been created yet, results in the app crashing 

4. Changing orientation glitches some of the sizing and placing of ui elements


// GENERAL FEEDBACK

1. Font colours of placeholder txt in both registration and log in screens should contrast better due to poor visibility

2. Upon successful registration the app should automatically log in and take the user to the dashboard.

3. Exercise 3. (Crying face) provides the both the options "sad" and "crying" too ambiguous, leading to user frustration,

4. Some of the representations for body language exercises are too similar leading to confusion

5. Emotion recognition exercises should have greater than 3 options, 5-6 as it means the user is required to sit and think carefully their choice.

6. Slightly greater consequence for failure needed, doesn't emphasise wrong interaction,

7. Slightly greater praise for successful exercise completion,
